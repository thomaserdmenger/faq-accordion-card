## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to position multiple images with position relative and absolute. I also learned to set specific classes in CSS, which I set to specific DOM elements using the classList() method in JS to achieve the desired effect on the screen.

The most difficult thing for me was to position the images correctly.
